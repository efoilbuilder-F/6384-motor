# 6384-motor duct
This is a very heavy duct. The duct can be printed with 5 to 7 perimenters with the big duct attached to the build plate. Support structure is only necessary in the center for the cicular mounting part. The duct can be printed in PLA. It should use about 550g of PLA.
The duct has a lot of drag. To reduce drag the duct can be removed from the mastclamp/motormount. The Motormount contains four 5mm M3 heat set inserts. The Duct slides over the motor to the mastmount while the propeller is not attached.
